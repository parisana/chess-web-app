# Roadmap

Reviewed on 26 October 2026 against `chess-web-app-day10-end.zip`. Source inspection confirms the Day 10 king-movement changes and associated tests. No blocking defect was found in the reviewed changes. The user reports all tests green for this archive. No independent tests or builds were run; no detailed test log or separate frontend build result was supplied.

## Working-session numbering

Working Days 1–10 identify actual development sessions and differ from the original 30-working-day estimate. Earlier work completed some planned later capabilities early. This page records implemented sessions and remaining capabilities; it does not establish a new complete 30-day schedule.

## Completed working sessions

| Session | Delivered scope |
| --- | --- |
| Days 1–3 | Project setup, authentication/profile foundation, Angular authentication and persistent queue foundation |
| Day 4 | Initial game persistence, active-player reservations, transactional pairing, matched-game discovery and participant-protected retrieval |
| Day 5 | Authenticated username PATCH, backend tests and Angular profile editor |
| Day 6 | Immutable representation, separate FEN parser/serializer and initial-position rules boundary |
| Day 7 | Move/board relocation, knight movement, candidate application, all-piece attack detection, king-safety filtering and test rendering |
| Day 8 | Strategy dispatch, rook movement, shared pipeline and corner-rook castling-right updates |
| Day 9 | Shared sliding traversal, bishop/queen strategies, centralized movement fixtures and pipeline tests |
| Day 10 | Ordinary king candidates, resulting-square king safety, irreversible king castling-right removal and associated tests |

The final Day 10 archive contains these movement additions, and the user reports all tests green. Source review found no blocking defect in the Day 10 changes; tests/builds were not run independently.

## Original-plan reconciliation

Earlier planning placed security around original Day 5, connected login/profile/frontend around Days 6–7, rules/library selection around Day 8 and game persistence around Day 9. Those original estimates are distinct from the working-session labels above. The project selected its own rules implementation with a future library-adapter option. Initial persistence arrived before rules completion. The full original schedule is not reproduced here.

## Day 10 completion boundary

King movement is one square in all eight directions. Shared filtering examines the moving side's king on each resulting board. A king move removes both rights for that color; returning never restores them. Tests cover both colors, attacks after vacating the source, king adjacency, captures, pinned attackers, pawn/knight attack directions, metadata and existing-piece regressions.

Castling execution, pawn movement, outcomes and service/HTTP integration were excluded from this bounded milestone and remain pending.

## Proposed next increment — Day 11

Introduce ordinary pawn movement for both colors: one-square advances, initial two-square advances with both squares clear, diagonal non-king captures and occupancy/turn checks. Update shared application for pawn halfmove-clock resets and double-advance en passant targets, and verify pawn king-safety filtering.

Promotion, en passant capture execution and castling execution need explicit subsequent scope. Until promotion is represented, attempts to generate/apply moves reaching the last rank must fail explicitly rather than silently yielding an incomplete legal-move result. This next increment is proposed, not implemented or accepted as a final scope.

## Remaining capabilities to schedule

- Complete pawn rules, promotion, en passant and castling execution.
- Complete legal-move enumeration and game outcomes.
- Server-authoritative gameplay commands, persistence/history and concurrent-update handling.
- Game lifecycle/results and safe active-reservation release.
- Chessboard/game UI and clocks, where selected for the MVP.
- Internal events and authenticated, authorized real-time delivery; WebSocket/STOMP remains a candidate.
- Queue lifecycle improvements such as expiry and any selected acceptance/cancellation/rating behavior.
- Account email/password changes if selected.

Acceptance, cancellation, rating filters and expiry require an explicit scope decision. Redis/Kafka, spectators, tournaments, chat, engine analysis and distributed scaling remain outside initial scope. AI is outside the MVP. Map-versus-array storage evaluation stays deferred unless demonstrated benefits justify it, preserving the Board API.

## Engineering constraints

Keep the modular monolith, Player terminology and cross-feature service boundaries. The rules package remains free of Spring/JPA/HTTP concerns. `ChessRules` still exposes only `initialPosition()`; no service applies moves. A subset of supported pieces cannot determine checkmate/stalemate. Candidate generation excludes king captures; attack detection includes pinned attackers. FEN is structural state, not proof of reachability or repetition history. Preserve useful comments, coherent FEN fixtures, selected board renderings, minimal frontend testing and user-managed secrets/configuration.
