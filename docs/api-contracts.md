# API Contracts

## Day 19 current checkpoint — source-reviewed, 29 October 2026

Reviewed the actual user archive `chess-web-app-day19-end.zip` against `chess-web-app-day18-end.zip`. No blocking defect was found in the reviewed Day 19 changes. Two small follow-ups are supplied inline and recorded in [the review](day19-frontend-gameplay.md): add a submission guard to Game.refresh() and clear obsolete move feedback after a successful GET. They are not applied to production source by this documentation package.

The Angular frontend now supports guarded matched-game navigation, participant-protected game reads, a custom Player-oriented click-to-move board, explicit promotion including cancellation, versioned move submission, manual refresh, stale-state reload without command retry, uncertain-outcome blocking and completion feedback. Game and ChessBoard use separate TypeScript, HTML and CSS files.

The backend tree is byte-for-byte unchanged from the Day 18 archive. No new endpoint, migration or backend runtime configuration is introduced. The cm-chessboard dependency, declarations and asset/style additions are absent. package.json is unchanged; package-lock.json contains 15 package-version changes, and angular.json differs only in formatting. Those user changes are preserved.

Tests are treated as green under the standing instruction to report failures. The assistant ran no application tests, builds, migrations or browser acceptance checks, and claims no separately verified frontend build/manual result. Source inspection is the evidence for this review.

See [frontend gameplay flow](frontend-gameplay-flow.md) for the lifecycle and Angular coordination, [Day 19 review](day19-frontend-gameplay.md) for findings and [next-session handoff](day19-handoff.md) for continuation. Earlier Day sections retain historical boundaries and do not override this checkpoint.

History, real-time delivery, clocks, additional draw rules, acceptance and disconnect/abandonment policy remain separate scope decisions. A board library is optional post-MVP polish, not an MVP requirement.

## Day 18 checkpoint — historical HTTP gameplay

Authenticated POST /api/v1/games/{gameId}/moves now delegates to the existing
GameService command using JWT-derived Player identity. SubmitMoveRequest
validates request shape before conversion into Move. Specific gameplay
rejections have game-owned HTTP status/code mappings.

GameResponse.from(game) maps participant-protected reads, now including
version, result, terminationReason and finishedAt. Successful move commands
return the existing GameMoveResult.

The HTTP tests cover committed commands, POST/GET agreement, authentication,
validation, failure precedence, special moves and terminal results/release.
Tests are treated as green under the user's standing instruction; no
independent tests/builds or final Day 18 archive review are claimed.

No migration, runtime configuration, rules implementation or frontend
implementation changes are included. History, frontend gameplay, real-time
delivery, clocks and disconnect policy remain pending.

See [Day 18 HTTP gameplay](day18-http-gameplay.md) for the contract and coverage.
Earlier checkpoint sections describe historical boundaries.

## Day 17 checkpoint — historical source review, 28 October 2026

Reviewed the actual user implementation in `chess-web-app-day17-end(1).zip` against `chess-web-app-day16-end.zip`. No blocking defect was found in the reviewed Day 17 production/test changes. Tests are treated as green under the user's standing instruction to report failures; this is user-provided verification context, not an independent run or a detailed per-command log. No tests, builds or migrations were run by the assistant, and no separate frontend build result is claimed.

`GameService.submitMove(gameId, requestingPlayerId, expectedVersion, move)` now coordinates participant/turn checks, exact legal application, resulting-position assessment, current-FEN persistence, stale/concurrent-command rejection and atomic checkmate/stalemate completion with reservation release. `GameMoveResult.from(game, assessment)` owns mechanical result mapping; `Game.finish()` calls its extracted switch-based `validateResult()`. There is no separate production GameMoveService.

V6 adds completion fields and consistency constraints. GameStatus is IN_PROGRESS/FINISHED, with separate result, termination reason and finish time. The unchanged game GET response fields can now carry an advanced FEN and FINISHED status; version/result/reason/time remain absent from that HTTP response. No HTTP move route, move history, frontend gameplay or disconnect policy is added. See the [reviewed implementation and verification commands](day17-gameplay-service.md).

Day 16 and earlier milestone sections below retain historical behavior/evidence. Their initial-only and pending-gameplay descriptions do not override this checkpoint. The earlier closing-test passing-status uncertainty is retained as historical provenance; current test status follows the user's later standing instruction.

### Historical Day 16 review provenance

Reviewed on 28 October 2026 against `chess-web-app-day16-end.zip`. Source inspection confirms the legality-enforcing facade, complete production strategy registration, facade regression tests and both [closing checks](day16-closing-checks.md). No blocking defect was found in the reviewed Day 16 changes. The user reports all tests green through increments 1–2. Both later closing tests are present, but no subsequent explicit passing report was supplied for them. No tests or builds were run independently; no detailed test log or separate frontend build result was supplied.

The Day 16 section describes the inspected implementation and supersedes earlier initial-position-only boundary and test-only-construction statements. Historical sections retain the behavior and evidence available at those checkpoints.

## Day 16 boundary — historical

`ChessRules` exposes `initialPosition()`, `legalMoves(position)`, `applyMove(position, move)` and `evaluate(position)`. Lookup returns the complete immutable legal set. Application requires exact membership in that set, including the promotion choice, before delegating to `MoveApplier`. Assessment returns `PositionStatus` for the side to move. The existing pipeline remains shared; no per-piece application services or duplicate movement algorithms are introduced.

`GameService` still calls only `initialPosition()` and serializes it for creation. Games remain at their initial FEN in `IN_PROGRESS`. Move submission, persistence/history, gameplay concurrency, terminal lifecycle and active-reservation release remain pending. No endpoint, DTO, migration or frontend implementation changes in Day 16. Authorization, transactions, persistence and concurrency remain service responsibilities.

The new facade methods are internal Java contracts. An absent legal proposal produces IllegalArgumentException; malformed Move values may fail at construction, and invalid positions fail through the existing validation pipeline. These are not newly assigned HTTP statuses or application error codes. NORMAL/CHECK/CHECKMATE/STALEMATE are not added to persisted GameStatus or the game response.

Historical Day 15 source-review provenance: reviewed on 27 October 2026 against `chess-web-app-day15-end.zip`. Source inspection confirms position-wide legal-move enumeration and `NORMAL` / `CHECK` / `CHECKMATE` / `STALEMATE` assessment for the side to move. No blocking defect was found in the reviewed Day 15 changes. The user reports all tests green after the final guided regressions. No independent tests or builds were run; no detailed test log or separate frontend build result was supplied.

This document lists expected application failures by action. It is not an exhaustive catalog of framework, transport or infrastructure failures. An absent application code is intentional where the current implementation does not guarantee one.

## Day 15 boundary — historical

Position-wide enumeration and position assessment are implemented internally. `generate(position, from)` remains source-specific; its empty result alone cannot determine an outcome. `generate(position)` collects all moving-side legal moves, and `PositionEvaluator` combines reply availability with current-board attack detection. `PositionStatus` is a rules assessment, separate from persisted `GameStatus`. `ChessRules` still exposes only `initialPosition()`; `GameService` still stores the initial FEN and does not apply moves. There is no move-submission endpoint, move history, terminal persisted lifecycle or active-reservation release. Repetition, move-count draws, dead-position detection, clocks, resignation and agreement are not evaluated. Authorization, transactions, persistence and gameplay concurrency remain service responsibilities. FEN parsing is structural, Board equality is identity-based, and repetition requires history. AI and map-versus-array evaluation remain deferred.

Day 15 adds no endpoint, DTO, migration, application error code or frontend behavior. Rules exceptions remain internal Java contracts. NORMAL/CHECK/CHECKMATE/STALEMATE are not new values in the game response.

## Shared conventions

- Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Protected self-service actions derive player identity from the validated JWT subject; clients do not choose the acting player ID.
- MVC validation returns Problem Detail with `code: VALIDATION_FAILED` and an `errors` array containing `field` and `message`. Rejected password values are omitted.
- Duplicate-identity and feature-owned exceptions return Problem Detail with their application code.
- Missing/invalid bearer credentials use Spring Security handling; no application code or uniform MVC error body is guaranteed.
- Deleted-player failures from profile GET/PATCH use `ResponseStatusException` with 401; no application code is guaranteed. Matchmaking has its own `AUTHENTICATED_PLAYER_UNAVAILABLE` code.
- Malformed JSON, incompatible field types, path conversion failures and unexpected server errors may have different bodies. Clients need a generic fallback.
- The frontend handles protected 401 session cleanup centrally; action-specific UI handles known codes. A 403 does not invalidate the session.

## Endpoint index

| Method | Route | Authentication | Successful response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/register` | Public | 201; `playerId`, `username`, `email` |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Public | 200; `accessToken`, `tokenType`, `expiresIn` |
| GET | `/api/v1/players/me` | Bearer JWT | 200; `id`, `username`, `email` |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/players/me` | Bearer JWT | 200; updated `id`, `username`, `email` |
| POST | `/api/v1/matchmaking/queue` | Bearer JWT | 200; queue status |
| GET | `/api/v1/matchmaking/queue/me` | Bearer JWT | 200; queue status |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/matchmaking/queue/me` | Bearer JWT | 204; no body |
| GET | `/api/v1/games/{gameId}` | Participant bearer JWT | 200; game state |
| POST | `/api/v1/games/{gameId}/moves` | Participant Bearer JWT | 200; GameMoveResult |

There is no public game-creation endpoint: pairing invokes creation internally. Participant-authenticated POST /api/v1/games/{gameId}/moves delegates to GameService. Pure rules exceptions are not themselves the HTTP contract; game-owned application exceptions map gameplay rejections.

## Register — POST `/api/v1/auth/register`

Request fields: `username`, `email`, `password`.

Username: nonblank, 3–30 Java UTF-16 string units. Email: nonblank, valid email format, at most 255 units. Password: nonblank, at least 8 units and at most 72 UTF-8 bytes. No trimming or normalization is applied. Success returns the registered identity without credentials or a token.

| Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid fields | 400 | `VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Username taken | 409 | `USERNAME_ALREADY_EXISTS` |
| Email registered | 409 | `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS` |

## Login — POST `/api/v1/auth/login`

Request fields: `email`, `password`. Email matching is exact. Login validates nonblank fields, email format/maximum length and the BCrypt byte maximum; it does not impose registration's minimum password length.

Success returns `accessToken`, `tokenType: Bearer` and `expiresIn` in seconds, with `Cache-Control: no-store`. The frontend then loads the self-profile. Unknown accounts and incorrect/missing local credentials receive the same invalid-credentials response.

| Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid fields | 400 | `VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Invalid credentials | 401 | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` |

## Read self-profile — GET `/api/v1/players/me`

No request body. Success returns the current database-backed `PlayerResponse` (`id`, `username`, `email`).

| Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing, invalid or expired token | 401 | Not guaranteed |
| Authenticated player no longer exists | 401 | Not guaranteed |

## Update username — PATCH `/api/v1/players/me`

Request:

```json
{
  "username": "new_username"
}
```

Success: 200 with the existing `PlayerResponse` shape:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "new_username",
  "email": "player@example.com"
}
```

### Rules

- Only the authenticated player's username changes. Email and ID are unchanged.
- Username must be nonblank and 3–30 Java UTF-16 string units long. Some supplementary Unicode characters occupy two units.
- Matching is exact and case-sensitive. Spaces and special characters are allowed; whitespace-only values are rejected. No trimming or normalization is performed.
- Submitting the current username succeeds without changing the entity or its update timestamp.
- Availability prechecks provide feedback; the existing PostgreSQL unique constraint protects against conflicting writes under concurrency.
- Existing JWTs remain valid because their subject contains the stable player ID.
- Concurrent edits to the same player's username use last-write-wins behavior.
- Missing/null username is invalid. This endpoint is a username-specific update, not a general JSON Patch or JSON Merge Patch implementation. Additional fields are outside its supported contract.

| Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid username | 400 | `VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Username taken | 409 | `USERNAME_ALREADY_EXISTS` |
| Missing, invalid or expired token | 401 | Not guaranteed |
| Authenticated player no longer exists | 401 | Not guaranteed |

A representative validation response is:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Request validation failed",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "One or more request fields are invalid",
  "instance": "/api/v1/players/me",
  "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "errors": [
    { "field": "username", "message": "must not be blank" }
  ]
}
```

Validation messages and the number of entries depend on the input and validator. Clients should use `field` and `code` rather than match literal messages.

## Queue join/status/leave

POST `/api/v1/matchmaking/queue` joins and attempts pairing. GET `/api/v1/matchmaking/queue/me` reads status. DELETE `/api/v1/matchmaking/queue/me` removes waiting membership and returns 204, including repeated leave requests.

Queue responses contain `status`, `enqueuedAt` and `gameId`. `WAITING` has an enqueue timestamp; `MATCHED` has a game ID. Inapplicable fields are null under the current DTO. Status is `NOT_QUEUED`, `WAITING` or `MATCHED`.

Repeated joins preserve the original waiting timestamp or return the existing active game. Leaving does not cancel an established game. Logout does not leave the queue. Pairing is triggered on join; clients currently refresh manually.

| Action | Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Join, status, leave | Missing, invalid or expired token | 401 | Not guaranteed |
| Join, status, leave | Authenticated player no longer exists | 401 | `AUTHENTICATED_PLAYER_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Join during pairing | Reservation conflict with another game-creation caller | 409 | `PLAYER_ALREADY_IN_GAME` |

An ordinary repeated join by an already matched player returns 200 `MATCHED`; it is not a conflict. The reservation-conflict case describes a competing creation race and rolls back the pairing transaction.

## Read game — GET `/api/v1/games/{gameId}`

No request body. Success returns id, whitePlayerId, blackPlayerId, status, currentFen, createdAt, version, result, terminationReason and finishedAt through GameResponse.from(game). Either participant can read; opponent profile/email is not returned. New games start in IN_PROGRESS at the initial FEN. Accepted commands advance FEN/version and may produce FINISHED. Completion fields are null during active play. GET does not reevaluate the position and has no positionStatus.

| Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing, invalid or expired token | 401 | Not guaranteed |
| Game does not exist | 404 | `GAME_NOT_FOUND` |
| Authenticated requester is not a participant | 403 | `GAME_ACCESS_DENIED` |

## Submit move — POST `/api/v1/games/{gameId}/moves`

Authenticated Player identity comes from the validated JWT subject.

```json
{
  "expectedVersion": 0,
  "from": "e2",
  "to": "e4",
  "promotion": null
}
```

expectedVersion is required and nonnegative. Coordinates are required lowercase algebraic squares from a1 through h8 and must differ. Promotion is omitted/null or exactly QUEEN, ROOK, BISHOP or KNIGHT; board-dependent validity remains in the rules pipeline. No automatic queen choice is supplied.

Success returns 200 with gameId, currentFen, version, positionStatus, status, result, terminationReason and finishedAt. positionStatus assesses the side to move and is NORMAL, CHECK, CHECKMATE or STALEMATE. Lifecycle is IN_PROGRESS/FINISHED; results are WHITE_WIN/BLACK_WIN/DRAW; implemented termination reasons are CHECKMATE/STALEMATE.

| Failure | Status | Application code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid request fields | 400 | VALIDATION_FAILED |
| Missing/invalid bearer credentials | 401 | Not guaranteed |
| Nonparticipant | 403 | GAME_ACCESS_DENIED |
| Missing game | 404 | GAME_NOT_FOUND |
| Finished game | 409 | GAME_ALREADY_FINISHED |
| Stale observed/concurrent version | 409 | STALE_GAME_VERSION |
| Wrong turn | 409 | NOT_PLAYERS_TURN |
| Well-formed illegal proposal | 422 | ILLEGAL_GAME_MOVE |

Request validation precedes service lookup. Well-formed command precedence is missing game, membership, lifecycle, version, turn and exact legal membership. Malformed JSON/incompatible types return 400 without promising VALIDATION_FAILED. Unexpected rules/stored-state failures are not broadly reclassified as client illegality.

Clients use the accepted response version for the next command. Reload stale state without automatically replaying a move. An uncertain network failure may follow a commit, so read before proposing another move.

The Angular page preserves GET-only participant metadata when applying a POST response. Both participants can read a finished game. Terminal release permits another queue join; no history-listing endpoint is implemented.

## Keeping contracts synchronized

When changing an endpoint, update its owning DTO/service/controller, corresponding integration assertions, this action's contract and the checkpoint progress together. Keep feature error constants in their owning package. Tests verify documented behavior; this document does not establish that a test run passed.

## Day 8 boundary

The guided Day 8 increment adds internal knight/rook Strategy dispatch, rook movement, shared application/filtering and rook castling-right updates. It changes no endpoint, response shape or frontend implementation. ChessRules still exposes only initialPosition(); persisted games still contain the initial state. There is no move-submission API or chessboard UI. The corrected fixture remains present in the final Day 9 source, for which the user reports all tests green.

## Day 9 boundary

The reviewed Day 9 source adds bishop/queen movement, shared sliding traversal, centralized test fixtures and pipeline tests. The user reports all tests green; none were run independently. No endpoint, response shape, frontend implementation or migration changes. Games still store the initial position; no move-submission API or chessboard UI exists.

## Day 10 boundary

Day 10 adds internal ordinary king candidates, resulting-square king-safety filtering and irreversible castling-right removal for moving kings. The shared test registry and tests are updated. Castling execution and pawn movement remain pending. No HTTP contract, DTO, migration, frontend implementation or persisted-game behavior changes. `ChessRules` still exposes only `initialPosition()`; there is no move-submission API or chessboard UI. The user reports all tests green for the final Day 10 archive; this review ran no tests or builds.

## Day 13 completed checkpoint — historical, 27 October 2026

En passant is implemented for both colors. Generation requires the correct source rank, one forward diagonal step, matching target metadata, an empty destination and an adjacent opposing pawn. An inconsistent or unavailable opportunity contributes no en passant candidate and does not suppress ordinary moves. Attempting an omitted capture fails exact candidate membership with `IllegalArgumentException`; no unsupported-en-passant exception remains.

`MoveApplier` validates candidate membership before identifying a pawn's diagonal move into an empty square as en passant. It relocates the pawn and removes the opposing pawn from `(destination.file, source.rank)` through immutable Board operations. `Board.removePiece()` requires a nonnull occupied square and performs placement only; callers own chess-rule validation. The original position remains unchanged.

Shared handling switches turns, resets the pawn halfmove clock, increments the fullmove number after Black, and expires the target. En passant preserves existing castling rights. Ordinary moves, promotion choices and irreversible king/rook rights removal remain supported. An occupied diagonal follows ordinary capture rules even if inconsistent target metadata names it; no adjacent pawn is removed in that case. Promotion choices attached to en passant fail candidate membership.

`LegalMoveGenerator` remains shared and unchanged. It checks the moving side's king after both pawn squares have been vacated. Tests cover both colors, both capture directions in generation, FEN results, original-position preservation, missing/inconsistent metadata, absent/friendly/non-pawn adjacent pieces, wrong source ranks, occupied targets, opportunity expiry, ordinary advances instead of capture, castling-right preservation, invalid promotion choices, exposed rook/bishop attacks and removal of checking pawns. Board tests cover immutable removal and invalid removal inputs. The three obsolete unsupported-case tests were replaced. Selected tests use `com.chessapp.BoardTestRenderer`.

The user reports all tests green for the final Day 13 archive. Review was by source inspection; no independent tests or builds were run.

Movement remains internal pure Java code. `ChessRules` exposes only `initialPosition()`; `GameService` still stores the initial FEN and does not apply moves. Day 13 changes no HTTP contract, DTO, migration or frontend implementation. Castling execution, complete legal-move enumeration, outcomes, move history and gameplay integration remain pending. Generation handles a single source; an empty result cannot establish checkmate or stalemate. FEN parsing is structural, not proof of legality or reachability; the implementation does not reconstruct the preceding move from history. Board equality is identity-based, repetition requires history, and authorization, transactions, persistence and gameplay concurrency remain service responsibilities. AI and map-versus-array evaluation remain deferred.

## Day 14 boundary — historical, 27 October 2026

Standard castling for both colors and both sides is implemented internally. Candidate generation checks rights and placement; application relocates both pieces; legal filtering checks starting, transit and destination safety. See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for responsibilities and verification provenance. Day 14 changes no endpoint, DTO, migration or frontend implementation.

Movement remains internal pure Java code. `ChessRules` exposes only `initialPosition()`; `GameService` creates and stores the initial FEN and does not apply moves. Complete legal-move enumeration, outcomes, move history and gameplay integration remain pending. Single-source generation cannot establish checkmate or stalemate. FEN parsing remains structural, Board equality remains identity-based, and repetition requires history. Authorization, transactions, persistence and gameplay concurrency remain service responsibilities. AI and map-versus-array evaluation remain deferred.
