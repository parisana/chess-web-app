# Chess Frontend

Reviewed on 26 October 2026 against `chess-web-app-day11-end.zip`. Source inspection confirms the Day 11 ordinary-pawn strategy, shared metadata updates, registration and associated tests. No blocking defect was found in the reviewed changes. The user reports all tests green. No independent tests or builds were run; no detailed test log or separate frontend build result was supplied.

Angular 21 standalone application with Angular Material, reactive forms and in-memory authentication. Backend calls use relative `/api/v1` URLs.

## Run locally

From `frontend/`, use the project's declared npm 11.6.2 and a Node version accepted by the locked Angular packages:

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4200`. `npm start` loads `proxy.conf.json`, forwarding `/api/**` to the separately running Spring backend at port 8080. Plain `ng serve` does not enable this proxy automatically.

## Build and minimal tests

```bash
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build
```

Five focused tests in `src/app/auth/services/auth-flow.spec.ts` cover bearer attachment, external URL exclusion, protected 401 cleanup/redirect, cleanup after profile loading fails, and logout. There is no `app.spec.ts` in this checkpoint. No end-to-end runner is configured.

Day 11 rules-test results are user-reported. No independent tests/builds or separate frontend build/manual-check results are recorded.

## Authentication behavior

Registration and login use Material forms. Login loads `/api/v1/players/me` before establishing an authenticated session. Home is guarded. Logout clears the in-memory token/player and returns to login; a browser reload also loses the session.

The interceptor attaches bearer tokens to relative protected API requests. A protected-request 401 clears the matching session and redirects an established player to login; a 403 does not clear the session. Failed form submissions preserve passwords. Successful login clears the password; successful registration resets the form.

## Username editing

Home embeds the standalone `ProfileEditor` component. It initializes the form from the in-memory player, validates a nonblank username of 3–30 UTF-16 string units, and calls PATCH `/api/v1/players/me` through `PlayerApiService`.

The existing interceptor attaches the token. A successful response updates `AuthSessionStore`, immediately updating the welcome message. The form then resets to the server-returned username. Errors preserve the input and show validation, conflict, session or fallback feedback. A response for a changed session is ignored. No new frontend test suite was introduced for this increment.

Usernames may contain spaces and special characters. No trimming or case normalization is performed. Email/password changes are outside this form. Username changes do not require a new token.

Manual checks: successful rename and immediate header update; duplicate rejection with input retained; invalid input feedback; navigating back to Home with the updated profile. Use the browser network panel to inspect PATCH response statuses/codes listed in [API contracts](../docs/api-contracts.md).

## Matchmaking behavior

Home loads queue status when opened and provides Material join, leave and refresh controls with progress/error feedback. It displays `NOT_QUEUED`, the enqueue time for `WAITING`, or the game ID for `MATCHED`.

Pairing runs on the backend when players join. The first player manually refreshes to discover the match. Leaving removes waiting membership without cancelling a game; logout does not leave the queue.

There is no game API service, game route, chessboard or real-time subscription in this checkpoint.

See [development-progress.md](../docs/development-progress.md) for current coverage and limitations, [architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md) for engineering decisions, and [roadmap.md](../docs/roadmap.md) for planning status.

## Day 11 completed checkpoint

Ordinary pawn generation for both colors, pawn halfmove-clock resets, double-advance en passant targets, shared registration and king-safety tests are supplied. Available promotion candidates and possible en passant captures fail explicitly; no partial candidate set is returned. These special moves and castling execution remain deferred.

No HTTP contract, DTO, migration, frontend implementation or persisted-game behavior changes. ChessRules exposes only initialPosition(); movement remains internal. The user reports all guided tests green; the final Day 11 source has been inspected with no blocking defect found in the reviewed changes. No tests/builds were run independently.

See [Architecture](../docs/architecture.md) for the precise movement boundaries.
